# Steam Engine Design and Animation
This project showcases the design and assembly of a steam engine, modeled in SolidWorks. The engine is inspired by a traditional steam engine used in steamboats and features a simple yet functional design. The key features of this project include:

## Design and Assembly: The steam engine parts were meticulously designed and assembled in SolidWorks, ensuring accuracy and functionality. The model is capable of generating at least half a horsepower and operates at a speed range of 300 to 400 rpm.

## Mechanism and Animation: To illustrate the steam engine's operation, a motor was utilized to animate the model, demonstrating the Steam Engine Slider Crank mechanism. This animation provides a clear visualization of how the steam engine converts steam power into mechanical work.

This project is a comprehensive representation of a steam engine's fundamental components and operations, offering both educational and practical insights into its mechanics.
